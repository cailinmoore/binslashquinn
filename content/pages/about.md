## Quinn Handley 
I'm Quinn - currently an undergradute student in the US studying computer engineering. I love working on embedded products due to the level of intimacy required with both the software and hardware components. Related interests are in high-performance computing, parallel processing, computer architecture, and all things linux. 

I'm an easygoing person who tries not to take themselves too seriously. I intended this website to be a brain dump of sorts. I'll make posts about anything I find intriguing or otherwise amusing. My hope is that over time - with more content - I can have an archive of past work/thoughts to look back on. If you find it interesting or want to reach out, feel free to do so through one of my social links below.

### Why is the site named /bin/quinn?
According to the [Linux Information Project](http://www.linfo.org/bin.html),
> */bin* is a standard subdirectory of the *root directory* in Unix-like operating systems that contains the *executable* 
> (i.e., ready to run) programs that must be available in order to attain minimal funtionality for the purposes of *booting*
> (i.e., starting) and repairing a system.

Not *only* does my name rhyme with bin, if we are indeed living in a computer simulation it would be my dream to reside within the essential bin subdirectory. Maybe one day I will learn of my fate when I am inevitably unallocated by the divine root user.
