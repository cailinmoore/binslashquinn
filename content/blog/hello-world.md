This being my first article, it seemed appropriate to recount the history of the well-known "hello, world" program.

These holy words are often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language as well as perform a 'sanity check' that things are behaving as they should. Beginners and seasoned veterans alike can attest to the simple yet rewarding feeling of seeing the blessed words "hello, world" appear on your display. It is a trial by which many of us first venture. But where did it originate? 

As I like to joke, nearly everything we hold near and dear to our hearts today can be traced in some shape or form back to Bell Laboratories. The original phrase "hello, world" was influenced by an example program in the 1978 book *The C Programming Language*. This, in turn, was inherited from an internal memo at Bell Laboratories in 1974 by Brian Kernighan's *Programming in C: A Tutorial*. Brian Kernighan was a computer scientist who contributed to the development of Unix and worked alongside such greats as Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie. 

The "hello, world" text output on a modern computer is analagous to a blinking LED in the embedded world - they both seek to demonstrate a base level of functionality and understanding between man and machine.
